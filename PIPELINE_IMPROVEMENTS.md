🎯 PROBLEM ADDRESSED:
   "The pipeline was too noisy, recommending broad-market ETFs like XLK 
   instead of focused pure-play opportunities like BOTZ. Need better 
   filtering to focus on high-conviction, specialized ETFs."

✅ SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED:

1️⃣ FREQUENCY-BASED FILTERING
   📍 Rule: ETFs must appear in ≥2 analyses per session
   📍 Logic: Only ETFs with momentum/confirmation qualify
   📍 Result: Eliminates one-off mentions and noise

2️⃣ SPECIALIZED ETF PRIORITIZATION  
   📍 Rule: Specialized ETFs (BOTZ, ITA, ICLN) prioritized over broad-market (XLK, QQQ)
   📍 Logic: Broad-market ETFs only included if no specialized alternatives qualify
   📍 Result: Pure-play thematic exposure preferred

3️⃣ CUMULATIVE CONFIDENCE SCORING
   📍 Formula: score = Σ(confidence_i) across all analyses mentioning that ETF
   📍 Logic: ETFs mentioned in multiple high-confidence analyses rank higher
   📍 Result: Quality signals rise to the top naturally

4️⃣ TECHNICAL OVEREXTENSION FILTER
   📍 Rule: Reject ETFs >3% above estimated support level
   📍 Logic: Avoid FOMO entries on momentum spikes
   📍 Result: Better entry timing, reduced risk

5️⃣ TOP-3 LIMITATION
   📍 Rule: Only show top 3 ETFs by cumulative confidence
   📍 Logic: Focus on highest-conviction opportunities
   📍 Result: Clean, actionable recommendations

6️⃣ AI PROMPT ENHANCEMENT
   📍 Rule: Explicit guidance to favor specialized ETFs
   📍 Logic: "Only recommend specialized thematic ETFs, avoid broad-market unless no alternatives"
   📍 Result: Better AI ETF selection from the start

INPUT: 6 analyses throughout the day
   • AI article 1: mentions BOTZ, ROBO, XLK (confidence: 8.5)
   • AI article 2: mentions BOTZ, ARKQ (confidence: 7.0)  
   • Defense article 1: mentions ITA, XAR, DFEN (confidence: 8.0)
   • AI article 3: mentions BOTZ (confidence: 6.5)
   • Defense article 2: mentions ITA (confidence: 7.5)
   • Tech article: mentions XLK, QQQ (confidence: 5.0)

STEP 1 - RAW MENTIONS:
   • BOTZ: 3 mentions (specialized AI/robotics)
   • XLK: 2 mentions (broad-market tech)
   • ITA: 2 mentions (specialized defense/aerospace)
   • All others: 1 mention each

STEP 2 - FREQUENCY FILTER (≥2 mentions):
   ✅ BOTZ: 3 mentions, 22.0 cumulative confidence
   ✅ ITA: 2 mentions, 15.5 cumulative confidence  
   ❌ XLK: 2 mentions, but REJECTED (broad-market)
   ❌ All others: <2 mentions

STEP 3 - TECHNICAL FILTER:
   ✅ BOTZ: 4.2% support gap (acceptable if <5%)
   ✅ ITA: 9.9% support gap (would be rejected if >5%)

FINAL OUTPUT: 
   🎯 BOTZ (AI/Robotics pure-play, 3 mentions, high confidence)
   🎯 ITA (Defense/Aerospace pure-play, 2 mentions, high confidence)

RESULT: Clean, focused, high-conviction specialized ETF recommendations!
